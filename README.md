## Metaheuristics

Heuristics: a technique, which seeks optimal or near-optimal solution at a reasonable cost

Metaheuristics: heuristics that are inspired by nature and not proble-specific

See overview.png


## Travelling Salesmen Problem - TSP

### Problem

- Visit all cities once and return to the same city
- Determine optimal route
- Symmetrical vs non-symmetrical
- See TSP.png figure

### Solution

Use 'Simulated annealing', see code

### Eigen bevindingen

- Lastig te volgen algoritme, see code
- About 22 seconds for 7 nodes.

## Vehicle Routing Problem - VRP

- NP
- combinatorial and integer problem
- Variations like:
    - Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)
    - Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW)

### Problem

- 5 trucks, 1 warehouse, 31 customers
- minimize distance travelled
- Constraints: 5 routes and truck capacity = 100

see screenshots

### Solution

- Use Tabu Search algorithm, see code
- About 100 minutes to get solution, see log.
